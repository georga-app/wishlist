# GeoRGA Wishlist

In this repositories issues you can make feature request, see the current state of features and discuss them.

This repository was inspired by the [CWA Wishlist](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-wishlist/)

## Structure
The repository does not contain any code. The issue tracker contains ideas for new features or enhancements of existing ones.

If it is decided to fix an issue or to implement a suggestion from an issue then the issue will be marked up in the originating repository (including in this one) using a label "Fix" + release number. This means that the issue will have a corresponding internal development status which is one of OPEN, ANALYZING, IN PROGRESS, COMPLETED, or CONFIRMED (i.e. tested). The Fix label stays with the issue even after the fix or enhancement has been released and the issue has been closed.

## How to find existing ideas
